=========

pytest-qt is a `pytest`_ plugin that allows programmers to write tests
for `PyQt5`_, `PyQt6`_, `PySide2`_ and `PySide6`_ applications.

The main usage is to use the ``qtbot`` fixture, responsible for handling ``qApp``
creation as needed and provides methods to simulate user interaction,
like key presses and mouse clicks:


.. code-block:: python

    def test_hello(qtbot):
        widget = HelloWidget()
        qtbot.addWidget(widget)

        # click in the Greet button and make sure it updates the appropriate label
        qtbot.mouseClick(widget.button_greet, QtCore.Qt.LeftButton)

        assert widget.greet_label.text() == "Hello!"


.. _PySide2: https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/
.. _PySide6: https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/
.. _PyQt5: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/
.. _PyQt6: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/
.. _pytest: http://pytest.org

This allows you to test and make sure your view layer is behaving the way you expect after each code change.

Features
========

- `qtbot`_ fixture to simulate user interaction with ``Qt`` widgets.
- `Automatic capture`_ of ``qDebug``, ``qWarning`` and ``qCritical`` messages;
- waitSignal_ and waitSignals_ functions to block test execution until specific
  signals are emitted.
- `Exceptions in virtual methods and slots`_ are automatically captured and
  fail tests accordingly.

Requirements
============

``pytest-qt`` requires Python 3.7+.

Works with either PySide6_, PySide2_, PyQt6_ or PyQt5_, picking whichever
is available on the system, giving preference to the first one installed in
this order:

- ``PySide6``
- ``PySide2``
- ``PyQt6``
- ``PyQt5``

To force a particular API, set the configuration variable ``qt_api`` in your ``pytest.ini`` file to
``pyqt6``, ``pyside2``, ``pyqt6`` or ```pyqt5``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    qt_api=pyqt5


Alternatively, you can set the ``PYTEST_QT_API`` environment
variable to the same values described above (the environment variable wins over the configuration
if both are set).
