=========

pytest-qt is a `pytest`_ plugin that allows programmers to write tests
for `PySide`_ and `PyQt`_ applications.

The main usage is to use the `qtbot` fixture, responsible for handling `qApp` 
creation as needed and provides methods to simulate user interaction, 
like key presses and mouse clicks:


.. code-block:: python

    def test_hello(qtbot):
        widget = HelloWidget()
        qtbot.addWidget(widget)
    
        # click in the Greet button and make sure it updates the appropriate label
        qtbot.mouseClick(widget.button_greet, QtCore.Qt.LeftButton)
    
        assert widget.greet_label.text() == 'Hello!'

.. _PyQt: http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt
.. _pytest: http://pytest.org

This allows you to test and make sure your view layer is behaving the way you expect after each code change.

Features
========

- `qtbot`_ fixture to simulate user interaction with ``Qt`` widgets.
- `Automatic capture`_ of ``qDebug``, ``qWarning`` and ``qCritical`` messages;
- waitSignal_ and waitSignals_ functions to block test execution until specific
  signals are emitted.
- `Exceptions in virtual methods and slots`_ are automatically captured and
  fail tests accordingly.

Requirements
============

Works with either PySide_ or PyQt_ (``PyQt5`` and ``PyQt4``) picking whichever
is available on the system, giving preference to the first one installed in
this order:

- ``PyQt5``
- ``PySide``
- ``PyQt4``

To force a particular API, set the configuration variable ``qt_api`` in your ``pytest.ini`` file to
``pyqt5``, ``pyside``, ``pyqt4`` or ``pyqt4v2``. ``pyqt4v2`` sets the ``PyQt4``
API to `version 2`_.

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    qt_api=pyqt5


Alternatively, you can set the ``PYTEST_QT_API`` environment
variable to the same values described above (the environment variable wins over the configuration
if both are set).

Bugs/Requests
=============

Please report any issues or feature requests in the `issue tracker`_.

.. _issue tracker: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-qt/issues

Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, so feel free to submit a bug or feature
request.

Pull requests are highly appreciated! If you
can, include some tests that exercise the new code or test that a bug has been
fixed, and make sure to include yourself in the contributors list. :)

Running tests
-------------

Tests are run using `tox`_. The simplest way to test is with `PySide`_ or Python
3.5 with PyQt5, as they are available on pip and can be installed by ``tox``
automatically::

    $ tox -e py35-pyqt5,py34-pyside,py27-pyside,docs

If you want to test against other `PyQt`_ combinations, install it into your
global python installation and use the ``py27-pyqt4``, ``py34-pyqt4`` or
``py34-pyqt5`` testing environments, and ``tox`` will copy the appropriate files
into its virtual environments to ensure isolation.
